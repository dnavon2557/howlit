##Description:
How Lit is a webapp that lets you genereate a playlist based on how "lit" you
want the music to be. Simply drag the 'litometer' to your desired level and
select a genre. Once the "Turn Up" button is pressed, How Lit will show you the
perfect playlist for your current mood. HowLit is powered by the EchoNest and
the Spotify Web API.
##Todo:
1. Display songs when logged in
2. Add save playlist option when not logged in to Spotify
